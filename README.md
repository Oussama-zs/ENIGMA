## **How It Works**

1. **Text Input/Output**:
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input box.
   - The result will be displayed in the output area.

2. **Settings Configuration**:
   - Configure the **3 cases** by selecting a number between 1 and 26 for each case.

3. **Plugboard Customization**:
   - Swap letters using the plugboard to create a personalized encryption scheme.

4. **Encrypt/Decrypt Buttons**:
   - Click these buttons to perform the encryption or decryption process.

5. **Reset Button**:
   - Reset all settings and clear input/output fields to start fresh.

## **For Non-Technical Users: Run the Program Directly**

If you're not familiar with Python or programming, don't worry! You can still use the **Dynamic Encryption Machine** without installing any software. We’ve provided a ready-to-use **executable file** (`.exe`) that you can download and run directly on your computer.

### **Steps to Run the Program**:
1. **Download the Executable File**:
   - Click the link below to download the `.exe` file:
     - **[Download Executable](ENIGMA.exe)**

2. **Run the File**:
   - After downloading, locate the file on your computer (usually in your `Downloads` folder).
   - Double-click the file to run it.

3. **Use the Program**:
   - Once the program opens, follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt your text.

### **Important Notes**:
- **Security Warning**: Some antivirus programs might flag `.exe` files as suspicious. This is a false alarm, and the file is completely safe to use. If you encounter any issues, you can temporarily disable your antivirus or mark the file as safe.
- **No Installation Required**: The `.exe` file is a standalone program, so you don’t need to install Python or any other software.

### **Prefer Running the Python Script?**
If you're comfortable with Python, you can also run the program directly from the source code.
